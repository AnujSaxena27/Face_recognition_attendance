# Face_recognition_attendance
Face Recognition-Based Attendance System is a Python application that automates attendance marking using facial recognition technology. The system uses OpenCV to capture and recognize faces, Tkinter to provide a user-friendly graphical interface, and MySQL to store attendance records.

Users can register their face using a webcam, and the system will save 100 samples to ensure accurate recognition. During attendance, the system identifies the face in real-time and marks the attendance along with a timestamp. The recorded attendance can be viewed through a GUI window for verification.

This project is ideal for schools, colleges, and workplaces looking to modernize and automate their attendance processes with minimal human intervention.
